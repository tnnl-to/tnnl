# Phase 1 Progress - Screen Capture Implementation

## ✅ Completed

### Core Screen Capture Functionality
- **Screen capture module** (`src-tauri/src/screen_capture.rs`)
  - Implemented using `screenshots` crate (cross-platform, works with Command Line Tools)
  - Background capture loop running at 10 FPS
  - Frame counting and statistics tracking
  - Permission checking for macOS

- **Tauri Commands** (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`)
  - `start_screen_capture` - Initiates capture with permission checks
  - `stop_screen_capture` - Stops capture and reports statistics
  - `get_capture_status` - Real-time stats (frame count, FPS, duration)
  - `get_displays` - Lists available displays with resolution info
  - `check_permissions` - Validates screen recording permission

- **Enhanced Frontend** (`src/main.ts`, `index.html`)
  - Real-time statistics display (frames captured, duration, FPS)
  - Permission status checking
  - Display enumeration on startup
  - Improved UI with dark theme
  - Live stats polling every second while capturing

### Technical Details
- **Frame rate**: Currently 10 FPS (100ms intervals)
  - Conservative to avoid performance issues
  - Can be increased in Phase 2 with WebRTC optimization

- **Permissions**: Automatic macOS Screen Recording permission request
  - First capture attempt triggers system dialog
  - Clear error messages guide user to Settings

- **Architecture**: Background Tokio task for continuous capture
  - Non-blocking capture loop
  - Thread-safe state management with RwLock
  - Graceful start/stop with statistics reporting

## 🎯 What Works Now

1. **Launch the app**: `npm run tauri dev`
2. **Check permissions**: App detects if screen recording is allowed
3. **View displays**: Console shows available displays and resolutions
4. **Start capture**: Click "Start Screen Capture"
   - macOS will prompt for permission (first time)
   - Background task begins capturing at 10 FPS
5. **Monitor stats**: Real-time display of frames captured, duration, average FPS
6. **Stop capture**: Click "Stop Capture" to end session
   - Shows summary statistics in console

## 📊 Current Statistics Display

When capturing:
```
Capturing: 150 frames
Duration: 15.2s
Avg FPS: 9
```

Console output:
```
[tnnl] Found 1 screen(s)
[tnnl] Primary screen: 3024x1964
[tnnl] Test capture successful: 3024x1964 pixels
[tnnl] Starting capture loop at 10 FPS
[tnnl] Captured 150 frames in 15.20s (avg 9.8 fps)
```

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Why `screenshots` Instead of `scap`?
- `scap` crate requires full Xcode installation (not just Command Line Tools)
- `screenshots` works with Command Line Tools alone
- `screenshots` is simpler but sufficient for Phase 1
- For Phase 2: Can upgrade to ScreenCaptureKit via different bindings

### Performance Considerations
- 10 FPS is intentionally conservative
- Each frame is ~36MB raw (3024x1964x4 bytes for RGBA)
- No encoding yet (Phase 2 will add H.264 compression)
- Frame data is captured but not stored (prevents memory bloat)

### Permission Flow
1. App starts → checks if `Screen::all()` works
2. First capture attempt → macOS shows permission dialog
3. User grants permission → capture begins
4. Permission persists across app restarts

## 📁 Updated Files

### New/Modified Rust Files
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Added screenshots, parking_lot, image crates
- `src-tauri/src/screen_capture.rs` - Complete implementation (242 lines)
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Registered 5 Tauri commands

### New/Modified Frontend Files
- `src/main.ts` - Enhanced with status polling, display enumeration (142 lines)
- `index.html` - Added styled UI with stats display

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2 - WebRTC)

Ready to move on when you are! Next steps from NEXT_STEPS.md:

1. **Add WebRTC dependencies**
   ```toml
   webrtc = "0.11"
   tokio-tungstenite = "0.24"
   ```

2. **Implement signaling server**
   - WebSocket server for peer connection setup
   - Offer/Answer exchange
   - ICE candidate negotiation

3. **Create media pipeline**
   - H.264 encoder for captured frames
   - WebRTC video track creation
   - Adaptive bitrate based on connection

4. **Build client PWA**
   - Video player component
   - WebRTC peer connection
   - Input event handlers (mouse/keyboard)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

- **macOS only**: Cross-platform support exists but only tested on macOS
- **No encoding**: Raw frames captured but not compressed yet
- **No streaming**: Frames counted but not sent anywhere (Phase 2)
- **Single display**: Only captures primary display for now
- **10 FPS limit**: Conservative for testing, will increase with encoding

## 💡 Testing Tips

### First Run
You'll see permission dialogs - grant them:
1. System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
2. Enable `tnnl` in the list

### Viewing Logs
- Open DevTools (automatically opens in dev mode)
- Check console for detailed capture logs
- Terminal shows Rust println! output

### Performance Monitoring
- Watch Activity Monitor for `tnnl` process
- Should use ~2-5% CPU at 10 FPS
- Memory stable around 100-200MB

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Ready for Phase 2 WebRTC 🚀
